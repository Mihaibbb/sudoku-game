                Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle.<br> 
                <strong>In classic sudoku</strong>, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.<br>
                <strong>In competitive sudoku</strong>, the objective is to finish the game as fast as possible and make as few mistakes as possible, if you make a good score you might get in the leaderboard leaders.<br>
                <strong>In reverse sudoku</strong>, this is a creative one, where you need to give computer a valid combination of sudoku and it will resolve it for you.<br>
                This game is normally played on paper with a pen/pencil, but this is a sudoku online game.

                In the early days of the Sudoku craze, Sudoku used to be played with pen and paper. Commuters played Sudoku on newspapers on their laps, or in paper Sudoku books with dozens or hundreds of pages of puzzles.<br>
                However, with the rise of digital technology, as mobile phones got smarter and became capable of hosting mobile apps, Sudoku is now able to be played online or from smartphone apps, without any pencil or paper required. While some people surely miss the old ways of playing on paper, for the most part it’s much easier, more fun and just better overall to play Sudoku online.
