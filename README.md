# sudoku-game
It's a sudoku game (web application) made by me from scratch(step by step) and the project it's completed about 80% of it.  It's an interactive way to play this game and have game modes to play (so if you get bored of one, you can play a different mode). The most interesting one (personal opinion) it's the reverse mode one, where you get a empty board and you put any numbers in any cells (only that the combination on the board must be correct, otherwise the game will tell you that your board has no solution) and then it will solve it for you (with a nice animation and transition) Technologies that I used: JavaScript (with ES6) and PHP (with MySQL database)
